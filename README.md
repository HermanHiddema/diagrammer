* Click any item in the toolbar to change to that tool.
* Markers can go on empty intersections or stones, labels only on empty intersection.
* Move numbers move up automatically (but can be set manually). Right-click the last move to undo it.
* Clicking the stone with 1 on it on the far right of the toolbar changes the starting color.
* When the tool is the black stone, right click makes white stones, and vice-versa.
* You can drag any corner or edge of the board to resize the view port, thus creating partial board diagrams.
* If you want to try a different size board, add #WxH after the url. Shortcuts: [9x9](http://hiddema.nl/diagrammer/#9x9) [13x13](http://hiddema.nl/diagrammer/#13x13)[9x9](http://hiddema.nl/diagrammer/#19x19)
